// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(2+4=6)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

The sum of 2 numbers is even

(Start
1. Print "Enter Any Number to Check, Even or Odd"
2. Read input of a number
3. If number mod = 0
4.  Print "Number is Even"
5. Else
6.  Print "Number is Odd"
7. End

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(1.BEGIN
 2.NUMBERS SUM 2,4,6,8,10
 3.OUTPUT("2:")
 4.INPUT 2
 5.OUTPUT("4:")
 6.INPUT 4
 7.OUTPUT("6:")
 8.INPUT 4
 9.OUTPUT("6:")
 10.INPUT 6
 11.OUTPUT("8:")
 12.INPUT 8
 13.OUTPUT("10:")
 14.INPUT 10
 15.Sum 2+4+6+8+10
 16.OUTPUT sum (30) 
 17.print("Enter five integers:"):scanf("%d %d %d %d %d, & number1, number2, number3, number4 & number5)
 18.Calculate quotient = product // 5
 19. Print 30

If the number is greater 2 say the number is 6.
If the number is greater than 6 say the number is 10
6>2 but <10
